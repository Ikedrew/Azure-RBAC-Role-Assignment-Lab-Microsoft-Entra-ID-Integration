# Azure-RBAC-Role-Assignment-Lab-Microsoft-Entra-ID-Integration

üìå Objective:
Demonstrate role-based access control (RBAC) in Azure by assigning the Reader role to a user created in Microsoft Entra ID, and verifying limited access permissions via portal login.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used:
Azure Portal (Free Tier)
Microsoft Entra ID (Default Tenant)
Resource Groups
Access Control (IAM)

ü™ú Steps Performed:
Created a Resource Group named Test-RG-RBAC.
Created a new Entra ID user named TestUser1.
Assigned the "Reader" role to TestUser1 at the resource group level using Azure RBAC.
Logged in as TestUser1 in a private browser to verify:
‚úÖ Read-only visibility to the resource group.
‚ùå Blocked access to create or modify resources.
Confirmed assigned role using the ‚ÄúCheck Access‚Äù feature in the IAM tab.

üí° Key Takeaways:
RBAC enables precise access control without sharing privileged roles.
Reader role is ideal for audit, monitoring, or trainee accounts.
IAM + Entra ID integration makes it easy to apply least-privilege policies.
